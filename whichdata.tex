\section{Which data is sensitive ?} \label{sec:which}

In communications thus far and in the security summit held on 6$^{th}$ April 2020 all data has been considered.

We believe the vast majority of the 20TB of nightly images are not of a sensitive nature.
It would be useful to understand if this is so, especially if delaying this data some period of time is sufficient to desensitize it. If this is the case do we need to encrypt all data ?

If there are patches of the sky which are sensitive can they be avoided at certain times ? e.g. Geo synchronous orbit stripe.
Are there other rough orbits we should delay data from ?

Or is it really the entire northern sky?
