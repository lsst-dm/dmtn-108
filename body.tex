\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

There is a perceived  risk that LSST  images may be snooped during transmission from the telescope. This concerns the images used for alert processing which are transmitted within a minute and provide a valuable resource for identifying moving objects including satellites. Though our processing will ignore satellites other parties may be interested in this information.

There have been several communications concerning encryption on the wire this gone into in some detail in \citeds{DMTN-163}.


\subsection{Baseline }
The Rubin Observatory construction project has been built with academic level security in mind.
The
 Information classification policy \citeds{LPM-122} classifies data as  “User Protected”.
The DM Information Security plan \citeds{LDM-324} states the “majority of network traffic will not require confidentiality“

Since our astronomy data is research data with no intrinsic value no great efforts have been made to secure the
data nor the network it is traveling on.
The network has been designed, and now largely implemented, for high throughput not for high security.

The baseline is for encryption of controls but not data i.e. authentication is encrypted, data transmission is not.

{\bf It would be extremely useful if we agreed on the security rating of LSST data (or subsets of it)  as per NIST  \citedsp{nist800-60}}. This is also one of the first steps in \citedsp{FIPS200} called out in \citedsp{NIST.SP.800-171}.
Naively one would assume the security objective would be \emph{Availability}, the potential impact would be \emph{low} for confidentiality, availability and integrity. Hence  the Security Category (SC) would be \{low,low,low\} in NIST terms.

\section{New requirements}
This is a list of new requirements which will require an LCR and costing.

The transfers from Summit to Base and Base to NCSA go over private networks that are not part of the public Internet. We have our own dedicated fibers running from the mountain to the base \citedsp{LSE-78},
intercepting transfers would require physical access to the fibers - tapping those would probably disrupt our network at least temporarily.

We understand there is a concern for the transmission of the images for alert processing and
 \citeds{DMTN-163} covers this in detail.

 \rec{IT}{netsec}{IT shall purchase routers capable of performing AES\cite{aes} IPSec in between Chile and SLAC.}
{At lease two routers will be needed and we may need four for failover. This is a multi million dollar commitment. }

If we do not transfer embargoed images to France or UK we understand encryption on the international links should not be needed.



\section {Physical Security}

On the mountain and in the base facility LSST networks and computers are in rooms requiring ID card access and the compounds have 24/7 security staff. We can increase physical security in Chile and SLAC.
Access from outside the site is only via VPN.
This also implies limiting the LSST personnel who have access to the files during the night.


\rec{IT}{physsec}{IT shall increase physical security in Chile and SLAC.} {
Physical measures shall include :
\begin{itemize}
\item Locks on server racks.
\item Sensors and cameras to record the opening of cabinets.
\item Out of band channel for physical security alerts if main network is disabled.
\item Access control devices to server rooms that record entry/exit by personnel.
\item Auditable processes to handle on-boarding, off-boarding, maintenance work, removable media, etc.
\item For the secure delayed store :
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Controls to prevent booting from USB devices or copying to external media.
	\item Full disk encryption to protect against theft or returns of hardware.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
